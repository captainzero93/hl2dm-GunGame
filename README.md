# HL2DM Gun Game Sourcemod

Progress through weapons by eliminating other players. Each kill advances you to the next weapon. The first player to get a kill with the final weapon wins!

I have also included mods to clear the maps of weapons and grenades and provide infinite ammo. 
## Weapon Progression

1. SMG1
2. Pulse Rifle (AR2)
3. Shotgun
4. .357 Magnum
5. Crossbow
6. RPG
7. Pistol
8. Stunstick (Final Weapon)

## Special Rules

- **Crowbar** is always available EXCEPT on the final level
- **Gravity Gun** remains with you through all levels
- Killing someone with the **Crowbar** will demote them one level!
